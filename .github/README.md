This is where I keep all of my dotfiles.

Feel free to copy any of the dotfiles or scripts you find here, as much of it is just copied from others' dotfiles. I wouldn't recommend cloning my entire setup, but instead to try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you.

In the future I'm planning on adding an install script to make it easier for others to use my configs. For now, you'll have to piece things together yourself, though.

## Where is everything?

Most config files for various programs can be found in the `.config` directory. Shell scripts can be found in the `.local/bin` directory. Environment variables can be found in `.zshenv`.

## Where's all of your old config files?

I'm now using Wayland instead of Xorg. I've done a lot of videos before about Xorg, so if you're looking for old config files that may not be there anymore, you can take a look at the [`xorg` tag](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/dotfiles/tree/xorg) for my old, unmaintained Xorg config files.
